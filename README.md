# Introducing Myself

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alex, a fresh graduate with a strong interest in Data.

The tools I primarily use are Microsoft Office, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. 

Currently, I am seeking opportunities to utilize and further develop my data analytics and technical skills to help businesses make data-driven decision making and improve their organizational performance.

This is my portfolio, where I showcase my [projects](https://alexanderevanw.github.io/).
